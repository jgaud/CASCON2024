## Detection of Novel Cyberattacks using Multi-Binary Classifiers

This repository contains the code used in the empirical tests conducted in the paper *"Detection of Novel Cyberattacks using Multi-Binary Classifiers"* [1].

This repository is organized as follows:
* **Detection of Novel Cyberattacks using Multi-Binary Classifiers.ipynb** file - contains all the code for reproducing the experiments presented in the paper;
* **Graph Generation.ipynb** file - contains the code used to generate the figures presented in the paper;
* **Results.xlsx** file - contains the aggregated results in an Excel workbook.

### Requirements
The experiments were implemented in Python. The source code can be executed by opening the *"Detection of Novel Cyberattacks using Multi-Binary Classifiers.ipynb"* notebook.

If you want to replicate the experiments by yourself, a working installation of Python (https://www.python.org/) and Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/) are required, as well as the following packages:

- Pandas (https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
- Numpy (https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
- LightGBM (https://pypi.org/project/lightgbm/)
- imbalanced-learn (https://pypi.org/project/imbalanced-learn/)
- Scikit-Learn (https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
- Matplotlib (https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)
